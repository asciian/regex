- `[:alnum:]` is expanded to `[A-Za-z0-9]`
- `[:alpha:]` is expanded to `[A-Za-z]`
- `[:blank:]` is expanded to `[ \t]`
- `[:lower:]` is expanded to `[a-z]`
- `[:upper:]` is expanded to `[A-Z]`
- `[:punct:]` is expanded to ``[\]\[!"#$%&'()*+,./:;<=>?@\^_`{|}~-]``
- `[:digit:]` is expanded to `[0-9]`
- `[:xdigit:]` is expanded to `[0-9A-Fa-f]`

## Installation
